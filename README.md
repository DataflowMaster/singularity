# Singularity

Since the beginning of time, humanity has had a single objective, to survive. Our genes harbor millions 
of years of data and information but their capacity has not yet been determined.
Singularity is a system to reply automatically the process of human decision related with the 
materialization of functions based in feelings with the goal of survive.
